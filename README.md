# Flashcards_exploratory

This is an initial repository to explore possible functionalities of a new app in progress.flashcards.

## The big picture

I would like to develop an app for learning the notes on a guitar fretboard using flashcards. To do this, I will break up the neck into seven positions, and the notes on each position will be learned in groups of triads and their inversions.

## Some detail

Cards are grouped into stacks. The user chooses a stack and cards are presented randomly from that stack. The user answers the question and self-grades his response. I would like to implement spaced repetition for the cards. So based on her grade for that card, the card is repeated at an appropriate time interval.
